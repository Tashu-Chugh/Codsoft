            Aryabhata, (born 476, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura, India), astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician whose work and history are available to modern scholars. He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura—near Patalipurta (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta dynasty—where he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c. 499) and the now lost Aryabhatasiddhanta.

                Aryabhata was an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics and astronomy. Here are some key points about Aryabhata:

                    <li>
                        Time Period: Aryabhata lived in the 5th century CE (476–550 CE), during the classical age of Indian mathematics and astronomy.

                    <li>
                        Aryabhata was born in Kusumapura, which is believed to be present-day Patna in Bihar, India.

                    <li>
                        His major work is the "Aryabhatiya," a Sanskrit astronomical treatise that covers various aspects of mathematics and astronomy. It consists of 121 verses.

                    <li>
                        Aryabhata calculated the value of π (pi) and gave an accurate approximation (3.1416) long before it was calculated in the Western world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aryabhata proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis, causing day and night. This heliocentric view was an early understanding of the Earth's rotation.

                    <li>
                        Aryabhata provided explanations for the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses. He understood that eclipses were caused by the shadows of the Earth and the Moon.

                    <li>
                        Aryabhata made significant contributions to trigonometry. He introduced the concepts of sine (jya), cosine (kojya), and inverse sine (otkram jya).

                    <li>
                        Aryabhata used a decimal system of numerals and place value, which was a significant advancement in arithmetic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aryabhata developed a calendar system, known as the Arya Panchang, to calculate time and various celestial events.
